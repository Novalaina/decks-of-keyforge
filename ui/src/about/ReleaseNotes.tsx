                                        Rating this set was and continues to be a challenge. More so than any other set
                                        it seems to have multi-card combos, which are
                                        much harder for the SAS system to rate properly. It's hard to properly capture
                                        the synergy between United Action, triple
                                        Final Analysis, a bunch of creatures, and a Data Forge for example. I do think
                                        these ratings are considerably more refined
                                        than the first version of MM ratings though, so I hope people find them
                                        reasonably accurate.

                                        I have a couple future changes planned that I think will further help improve
                                        deck scores, and DT scores in particular. One
                                        of them is rebalancing how SAS rates creatures and their power. Currently all
                                        creatures get a hidden 0.4 SAS bonus, as well
                                        as about 0.1 point per power / armor. I plan to make that more complex, and to
                                        rate lower power creatures a little less, and
                                        higher power / armor creatures a little more.

                                        The other change I have planned is to further refine the META scores. In

                                        score for low C decks, but I also plan to re-evaluate META scores in general for
                                        the new meta.
